    the cache needs to handle interruption mid set.
    the filestore needs to handle interruption mid set.
  If the server is interrupted mid-get.
    the cache needs to handle interruption mid get.

Integration Tests
  Hammering the server with multiple clients executing GET and SET
  Arbitrary length get/set
  Enable server restarts
Do I need a Shutdown method?
Keep Values in Memory and periodically flush.
Directory Sharding
Telemetry Support
  Spin a server which store* can communicate with
  Error Logging / Cache Hit Rates / File Store Hits
Support remote file storage (e.g. via a URL and a size).
Add a diagram explaining the architecture to help guide conversations.
  - Also include the JSONs that each server is expecting,
      e.g. client <--> API.
      e.g. store <--> StoreTelemetry.

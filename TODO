Move Concurrency Ownership:
  If there are many servers interacting with our filestore, it fails.
Recovery Failure:
  If we are reading a really large file, and it's interrupted, no big deal.
  If we are writing a really large file, and it's interrupted, big deal;
    reading it later might cause a breakage.
Integration Tests
  Hammering the server with multiple clients executing GET and SET
  Arbitrary length get/set
  Enable server restarts
Do I need a Shutdown method?
Keep Values in Memory and periodically flush.
Directory Sharding
Telemetry Support
  Spin a server which store* can communicate with
  Error Logging / Cache Hit Rates / File Store Hits
Support remote file storage (e.g. via a URL and a size).
Add a diagram explaining the architecture to help guide conversations.
  - Also include the JSONs that each server is expecting,
      e.g. client <--> API.
      e.g. store <--> StoreTelemetry.

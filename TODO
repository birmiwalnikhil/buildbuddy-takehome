Unit Tests (client / server / main).
Synchronizing Reads and Writes.
Support remote file storage (e.g. via a URL and a size).
Improve cache eviction performance.
Directory sharding.
Add a diagram explaining the architecture to help guide conversations.

  Add a instance to each Store
    A URL to hit every time something happens
    Could use gRPC or something to speed up performance.
  Error logging (client, server, etc.)
  Cache hit rates.
  File store hit rates.
  Cache error rates.
  File error rates.
  Latency metrics.
